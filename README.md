# Literacy Training Application

## Introduction
Literacy skills, which include reading and writing (Ellis, 1982; Houghton & Zorzi, 2003), are critical to communication. Studies have reported that adults with dyslexia have decreased success in educational environments and fewer opportunities for employment, and get overall lower paying jobs (MacDonald, 2009). All these factors contribute to higher rates of social anxiety and self- esteem problems in adults with learning disabilities (Jordan et al., 2014). Research evidence on appropriate remediation approaches with adults with dyslexia are few and far between. Mostly, remediation approaches consist of intense, specific skill-based training, but unfortunately, adherence rates and outcomes are marginal as these adults have life demands that make it difficult to attend remediation sessions on a regular and intensive basis. . In addition, there is some emerging evidence that training psychosocial factors (e.g., self-efficacy) has a positive impact on literacy-related outcomes (Aro et al., 2018; Peura et al., 2019). Here, we will evaluate the impact of skill and goal based training, accessed in a user-friendly format (i.e., mobile app), on literacy and mental wellbeing outcomes.
